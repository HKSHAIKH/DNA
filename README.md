# DNA
While computing with DNA molecules for the purpose of encoding an information, it is important that the molecules remain to be a single standard molecule, and do not form any inter or intra molecular structures. By treating DNA nucleotides as alphabet {A, C, G, T}, we developed a tool that would detect and output such structures.
